title: services renamed and backend config distribution improvements
---

the atheme services server has been renamed to `services.`

also wheeee i spent a bunch of time organizing the configs into little sections!
now instead of one long file i can include different modules, eg instead of searching for the right section where the opers live, i can just add a file in the `oper/` directory and it will do the rest!
i hope microsoft wont steal my link passwords though lol
